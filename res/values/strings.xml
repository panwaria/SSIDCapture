	 Version: 1.0 <br>
	 
	 <h3 style="text-align:center;color:gray;">ABOUT</h3>
	 The app has been developed by a team of researchers in the WiNGS laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA. The current version of the app is being provided at no cost for non-commercial use only. The app can be used to collect spectral samples from the WiFi bands and to analyze these samples to infer various non-WiFi devices (Bluetooth, ZigBee, cordless phones, microwave ovens) that are operating in the vicinity. The app also collects infrequent location information during its operation --- this allows us to analyze spatial behavior of spectral activity in the WiFi bands.
	 
	 <br>
	 <h3 style="text-align:center;color:gray;">ACCESS TO DEVICE DATA</h3>
The data from each device is uploaded to our server. A user can access this data using the unique key corresponding to this device. The user can locate this key from Settings. The app does not collect any identifiable information about the device that can be mapped
to this key, and hence this key provides anonymity to users and devices when they access the data. The data can be downloaded and stored as a CSV file.

	<br>
	<h3 style="text-align:center;color:gray;">USER CONTROLS</h3>
The app provides users with  multiple settings through which they can control the above behavior. The app can be configured to determine location using WiFi or cellular signals only, which is known to be less accurate than using GPS. The app can also be configured to completely disable collection of location information. Finally, the app provides an option through which no data is uploaded to the server.

	<br>
	<h3 style="text-align:center;color:gray;">DATA PLANS</h3>
All data upload to the server is done only over WiFi. Even if the device has a 3G/4G data plan, the collected data is never uploaded using such a plan. Hence, the user needs to keep WiFi on. 

	<br>
	 <h3 style="text-align:center;color:gray;">RESEARCH USE OF DATA</h3>
The data being collected in the server is going to be used for research purposes to better understand and analyze spectral behavior. The location information collected will allow researchers to understand spatial behavior of wireless interference patterns across bands. The data collected does not carry any personalized information of users, and hence no such analysis of personalized behavior is going to be attempted on this data. The spectral sample data collected may be published by the WiNGS laboratory team through a public data repository to benefit the broad community. The actual location coordinates of any individual device collected through this app will never to put in the public domain.
